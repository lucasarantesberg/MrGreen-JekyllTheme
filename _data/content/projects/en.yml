        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        #### Texts

        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.

        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        ## MonoAlg3D

        The MonoAlg3D is a program for solving the 3D monodomain model. It is given by a reaction-diffusion equation and is numeracally solved by applying the Finite Volume Method. The program is implemented in C and maintained by the FISIOCOMP research group. A main advantage of the solver is that not only is able to solve the monodomain equations and simulate the action potential propagation in heterogeneous tissue using both the CPU and GPU computing power, but can also handle non-uniform and non-conforming adaptive meshes. 

        In particular, my role in this project was to implement all the functions that enables the coupling of the Purkinje fibers in the ventricular tissue. The Purkinje fibers are basically the structure in the cardiac conduction system which are responsible for stimulating the ventricular cells in endocardium.

        Monodomain model:
