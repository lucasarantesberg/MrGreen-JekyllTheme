        ## MonoAlg3D 
        Source code available on: [https://github.com/bergolho/MonoAlg3D_C](https://github.com/bergolho/MonoAlg3D_C).

        The MonoAlg3D is a program for solving the 3D monodomain model. It is given by a reaction-diffusion equation and is numeracally solved by applying the Finite Volume Method. The program is implemented in C and maintained by the FISIOCOMP research group. A main advantage of the solver is that not only is able to solve the monodomain equations and simulate the action potential propagation in heterogeneous tissue using both the CPU and GPU computing power, but can also handle non-uniform and non-conforming adaptive meshes. 

        In particular, my role in this project was to implement all the functions that enables the coupling of the Purkinje fibers in the ventricular tissue. The Purkinje fibers are basically the structure in the cardiac conduction system which are responsible for stimulating the ventricular cells in endocardium.

        ## Shocker
        Source code available on: [https://github.com/bergolho/Shocker](https://github.com/bergolho/Shocker).

        The Shocker is a program for generating Purkinje networks (PN) in any type of endocardium surface which was implemented by me during my Phd. The Purkinje network 
        is part of the Cardiac Conduction System (CCS) and is responsible for activating the ventricular walls in synchronous manner.

        To generate a Purkinje network, the input data of the method is the following: an endocardium surface, a proximal location for the root branch, which must be within the endocardium surface. 
        
        In addition, the user can supply a set of active Purkinje-Ventricular-Muscles (PVJs) with their respective coordinates and Local Activation Time (LAT). In this scenario the Shocker method will try to connect
        the given active PVJs close to their reference LAT using optimization principles. 
        
        Furthermore, another feature of the Shocker program is that the user can also pass an initial configuration for the Purkinje network. This way well-known
        structures of the Purkinje system, like the Left-Bundle-Branch (LBB) and Right-Bundle-Branch (RBB), can be constructed beforehand using different techniques and be supplied as the initial
        network in order to provide better guidance of the regions that the PN certainly will occupy based on physiological observations. The second advantage of this feature is extending an already
        constructed PN by including different branches on its topology. For instance, these PNs could come as the output of another method already available in the literature. Thus, the user could want to
        increase its endocardium coverage or connect additional PVJs points, which is a feature that the available methods to generate PN in the literature currently do not have implemented.

        </div>

        The PN generated by the Shocker program were constructed in such way that they can be used alongside the MonoAlg3D program in cardiac simulations. 
        Here are a few MonoAlg3D simulations executed with different types of Purkinje networks generated by the Shocker program. The endocardium surfaces have an increasing level of complexity.
